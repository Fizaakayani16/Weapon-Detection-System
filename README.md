A real-time Gun Detection System built with Python, OpenCV, and Haar Cascade classifiers. This project uses a camera feed to detect guns using a custom-trained `cascade.xml` file and highlights the object on the screen when detected.

## 🛠️ Features

- Real-time object detection from webcam
- Haar Cascade classifier support
- Frame-by-frame detection with OpenCV
- Easy to modify and extend for other object detection tasks
